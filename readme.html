[x] Fixed an issue relative to picture and html file allowing configuration even if these files do not exist on the PC used for configuration.<br/>
[x] Added French and Swedish support. Language can be chosen from screenconfig.php. Default language is determined based on browser configuration. Thanks to Jens Kastensson for the Swedish translation.<br/>
<h4>Known bugs</h4>

<h2>Description</h2>
MopScreens is a set of php files to be used on a web server (mainly a local one) to display large event results in real time in an O'Ringen like style. It uses MeOS Online Protocol for data updating, and reuse part of the Mop example provided with MeOS.<br/>
Currently it can handle 12 screens, but can be extended to more screens very easily. Main limitation concerns relay : currently the team is limited to 3 members and to 3 radio controls per leg. The limitation in team size will be increased to 10 members within the next 6 months.<br/>
To get a better idea of what it looks like, have a look to the english documentation MeOSScreensEn.pdf<br/>
It is provided "as is" as open source code and can be freely used, modified, enhenced and distributed. It is licensed in the same condition as MeOS.<br/>
